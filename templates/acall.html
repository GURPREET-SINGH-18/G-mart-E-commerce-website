                        Say goodbye to the smelting heat of Indian summers by investing in an air conditioner (in)
                        India. Available in window and split design options, there are many variants for you to choose
                        from. Buy air conditioners (in) India online and select a model that suits your needs. TThere
                        are ACs of different capacities, energy ratings, inverter technologies, and condenser coils
                        across e-stores. Choose from ACs of various capacities ranging from 0.8 to 2 Tons depending upon
                        your requirements. ACs of small capacities are sufficient for smaller rooms with lesser exposure
                        to the sunlight. You can find air conditioners with energy ratings varying from one star to five
                        stars. This rating indicates how efficient the machine is in terms of electricity consumption. A
                        five star rated machine will be more efficient than lower ratings, thus helping you save on your
                        electricity bills. The inverter technology used in the device also reduces the load on the
                        compressor and further reduces your power consumption. Browse air conditioners (in) India from
                        top brands such as Voltas, LG, Daikin, Samsung, Hitachi and more. Browse and choose a model that
                        fits your needs and preferences. Add it to your shopping cart and keep your space cool in all
                        seasons. Shop for energy-saving ACs online on G-mart from Midea, Panasonic, Voltas, Samsung,
                        Daikin and Lloyd among other big names in the large appliance ac industry. This Information is

            <p>When Mother Nature turns the heat up, air conditioners help you keep cool and comfortable at your home or office. Due to various factors contributing to the global warming, nowadays air conditioners are becoming a necessity in many households and offices. An air conditioner is also said to be HVAC that stands for heating, ventilation and air conditioning appliance, and helps in maintaining suitable humidity and proper ventilation. An air conditioner also filters dust, soot and other microorganisms from the outside air in order to create a healthy ambience for you.</p>
            
            <p><span>There are several types of air conditioners available online. But which air conditioner to use depends upon a number of factors such as, the size of the area that has to be cooled and the total heat generated inside the enclosed area. The most common types of air conditioners that you can buy online include the following:</span></p>
            
            <p>Unlike a few colder regions in the western world, summers in most parts of India is not something that people look forward to. With the temperatures touching almost 50Â°C in some parts of the country, ACs have become an inevitable part of our lives. However, before we go ahead let us look into the basics of an air conditioner.</p>
            
            <h2><strong>What is an Air Conditioner and How Does it Work?</strong></h2>
            
            <p>An air conditioner is an electric appliance that helps you control the temperature of your room in a manner such that it is optimal and comfortable. A few advanced air conditioners can automatically adjust the temperature within the room as per the outside temperature, thus keeping you cool and comfortable.</p>
            
            <p>An air conditioner works almost on the same principle as a refrigerator. However, unlike a refrigerator that takes heat away from the items stored within it, an air conditioner absorbs the heat from an entire room. This helps reduce the temperature within the room. This process is done with the help of a chemical called refrigerant. During the cooling process, the indoor unit (IDU) of the air conditioner produces waste water which is drained out.<br>
            <br>
            Now that you know how an air conditioner functions, let us take a look at some of the most common types of air conditioners available in India.</p>
            
            <p><br>
            &nbsp;</p>
            
            <h2><b>Split AC</b></h2>
            
            <p>For rooms that do not have a proper window or if youâ€™re looking to install an appliance that not only helps keep the room cool but also enhances its aesthetic appeal, then split ACs are for you. A Split air conditioner consists of two units - a unit which is mounted outside the home and another which is in the room. The unit which is installed outside comes with a compressor and condenser which are connected to the indoor unit with a pipe. The compressor sucks air from outside, cools it and throws out cold air into the room using the blower of the indoor unit.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            These types of air cooling units are very common in households today, with LG ACs being a popular choice. Split air conditioners are more aesthetically pleasing compared to other types of air conditioners. They are easy to install and are capable of cooling your bedroom or even larger areas such as a living room. They can also be used in commercial establishments.</p>
            
            <p><br>
            &nbsp;</p>
            
            <h2><strong>Window AC</strong></h2>
            
            <p>One of the older forms of air conditioners, a window air cooling unit comprises a single unit with a combination of compressor and blower within it. It can be installed only in the window frame with the blower side of the air conditioner facing inside the room and the compressor facing outside. If your room has a window, then you can install window ACs.&nbsp;</p>
            
            <p><b>Portable AC</b><br>
            If youâ€™re looking for a cooling appliance that you can move from one place to another, then portable ACs are for you. This type of an air conditioner is fairly new to the Indian market and is designed just like an air cooler. Portable air conditioner can move from one room to another instantly and is a great option for homes where there is no feasibility to mount split / window units. You can move these types of cooling units from room to room in your home as per your convenience.<br>
            <br>
            If you are looking for a split air conditioner, Daikin AC or a Hitachi AC would be a good choice. O-General ACs would be another great option, if you are looking for a window air conditioner. Apart from these brands you can also look at other popular brands such as Blue Star, Voltas, MarQ, Samsung and more. Having an air conditioner at home is not an expensive affair. You can shop for energy-saving air conditioners online and get great discounts and prices.<br>
