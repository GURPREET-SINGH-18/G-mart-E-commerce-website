                        Is your refrigerator getting old? Well, this festive season bring home a new fridge for enhanced
                        and efficient cooling of your food products. Your shopping experience depends on your cooling
                        needs, your budget, and the fridge price. So, if you have a small family, then you can opt for a
                        single door product. Different types of single door products come with different features such
                        as a base drawer where you can organize your dry vegetables like potatoes and onions. Some

                        ease. On the other hand, if you have a large family or you buy a large number of products that
                        need refrigeration, then you can opt for a double door fridge. There are several models of
                        double door products available in the market and each has a unique feature. Some may come with
                        the freezer at the bottom, others can be converted to suit your needs and more. Your buying
                        choice here depends on your requirements and the refrigerator price. So, go ahead and find the
                        product that meets your needs and order it today. Once you place your order, it will be
                        delivered to your home in no time. Trusted brands like Samsung, LG, Whirlpool, Haier, Godrej,
                        Hitachi, Panasonic and MarQ by G-mart have a vast range of refrigerators to choose from. This

            <br>
            &nbsp;</div>
            
            <h2>Type of refrigerators</h2>
            
            <div>One of the first things that pops into anyone’s mind when it comes to fridges is their style. Are they compact enough to fit a small-sized room? Will they be large enough to accommodate the many of a large family? Based on your needs, you can choose from:</div>
            
            <div><br>
            <strong><span>Single door fridges</span></strong>&nbsp;– These are generally small refrigerators that are ideal for bachelors or small families. The freezer compartment is also built into the fridge.&nbsp;<span>A single door fridge is one where only one door is used to house your freezer as well as the cold storage unit. Such products are generally more compact in size and come with lower space, which makes them ideal for small families or for people who live alone. Now, there are different types of these appliances available in the market. However, these products also share some common features. For example, most single door products come with a defrost button to help clear out the ice build-up in the freezer. Nearly all of these products come with a dedicated vegetable box at the bottom so that your fresh fruits and vegetables can be organized in one place. Now, if we look at some unique features, then some of these appliances come with dedicated tall bottle shelves on the inside of the door so that you can store large water bottles or cold drink bottles with ease. Moreover, some of these products also come with drawers at the base where you can organize and arrange dry items such as potatoes, onions, garlic, and more, making it easier for you to access all of your ingredients in one place.&nbsp;</span></div>

That being said, most of these appliances are frost-free, which means that their compressors are intelligent enough to prevent the buildup of ice so that your appliance remains clean and easily accessible. Now, there are several types of double door fridges available in the market. Some of these appliances are convertible and can be morphed to suit your needs. Others can come with the freezer at the bottom so that you don’t have to bend too much to get your fresh items out.
