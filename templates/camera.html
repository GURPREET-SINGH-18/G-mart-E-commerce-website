                        Cameras, especially digital cameras, have become the rage in recent times. Most of the
                        photography enthusiasts have armed themselves with dslr camera recently from brands like Canon,
                        Nikon, Sony, GoPro cameras and are travelling to picturesque locations to capture stunning
                        moments and convert them into photographic images. Although point and shoot cameras from Kodak
                        and Sony are the still the preferred version of many expert photographers, digital cameras are
                        the ones that have expanded the possibilities of experimenting with different styles of
                        photography and help amateurs to click good pictures. Camera bags, tripods and lenses are
                        significant accessories that photographers need to carry with them always.

            <h2>Buy Camera Online â€“ Document Lifeâ€™s Best Moments</h2>

            <p>In this time and age when social media is a major platform for visibility, the need for good-quality
                pictures has multiplied sevenfold. A picture taken on a smartphone may be good, but itâ€™s not the same as
                one taken with a good-quality camera. Smart ones give you plenty of options to play around with
                lighting, effect, and distance so you have full control of your shots. Start with a basic
                point-and-shoot camera if youâ€™re a beginner and you can move on to more intense DSLR ones as you get
                more confident in your photography skills.</p>
            &nbsp;

            <p><b>Shop Smartly and Conveniently</b></p>

            <p>One of the greatest things about shopping online is that you can check out the latest cameras and compare
                different models while youâ€™re at home in your pyjamas, sipping on chilled drinks and binge eating
                comfort food. Online shopping sites also pamper you with enticing discounts on the best-selling cameras
                from Nikon, Canon, Manfrotto, Sony, Envie, and Sigma regardless of whether itâ€™s sale season or
                not.</p>
            &nbsp;

            <p>Pout, pose and click! Donâ€™t you just love cameras? Imagine a world without selfies, no profile pictures,
                no photography exhibitions and nothing to capture the breath-taking sunset. Basically, imagine a world
                without cameras. Difficult, right? It doesnâ€™t matter if you are not trained as a photographer, you can
                still take good pictures provided you have the right camera. And if you are a professional, then there
                is no better way to improve your skills other than upgrade what you already own. So, knowing a thing or
                two about the different types of cameras is a must. Give this article a quick read, and make a wise
                buying decision.</p>

            <p><b>DSLR cameras to get the most beautiful snapshot of a moment</b></p>
            

            <p>DSLR cameras (Digital Single-Lens Reflex Camera) are being widely bought and used today for various
                reasons that make them hugely popular. With large sensor area, high shutter speeds ( can capture up to
                10 frames per second), much better sensitivity to light, ability to use different lenses for different
                situations, great control over the depth of field( the ability to create beautiful bokeh) and many more
                such reasons prompt photographers into buying DSLR cameras online. It doesn't matter whether you want to
                click the photo of a wide landscape for which you would need a wide-angle lens like the Canon 24mm f/2.8
                lens, or you want to do some bird photography using the telephoto lens like the Nikon 300mm f/4 lens, or
                clock someone's portrait using portrait lens, they all can be mounted based on your requirement in to
                the DSLR camera. Go for a Nikon D3300 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 DSLR camera, Canon EOS 13000 DSLR, Nikon D 810,
                Pentax K5, Sony Alpha ILCE 6000Y or any such best DSLR cameras. Browse to find the best DSLR camera
                price online to shop for it at the most reasonable rate.</p>

            <p><b>What are the Different Types of Cameras?</b></p>

            <p><span><b><a href="/cameras/instant-cameras/pr?sid=jek,p31,ysu">Instant Cameras</a></b></span></p>

            <p>The name says it all, instant cameras are a cool balance of vintage cameras that come with film rolls and
                modern digital cameras. Fujifilm has an adorable collection of colourful instant cameras with some of
                them shaped like Hello Kitty. These cameras instantly roll out copies of the pictures you click. Some
                versions of these cameras feature a mirror near the lens so you can take selfies. Play around with your
                instant camera, take close up shots of objects or capture dreamy images by adjusting the brightness of
                your camera. Like all cameras, instant ones are also usually powered by batteries.</p>
            &nbsp;

            <p><b>Point-and-shoot&nbsp;</b></p>
            

            <p><a href="/cameras/point-and-shoot/pr?sid=jek,p31,nxa">Point and shoot cameras</a> are still cameras that
                are very compact in size and of lightweight that you can easily slip them into your pockets. They are
                primarily meant for simple photography operation with a fixed lens that has either focus-free or
                autofocus capability. You don't need to keep changing lenses while taking pictures in different
                situations and they also have a massive depth of field. Nikon B700, Sony DSC-W830, Nikon Coolpix B500,
                Canon IXUS 185 point and shoot cameras are some good ones using which you can learn basic photography.
                You can adjust the settings like mode and exposure automatically, so you donâ€™t have to do much other
                than holding the camera steadily. Also, they are usually compact, so you can take them along while going
                to parties or trips, and capture all your favourite moments. However, advanced point-and-shoot ones come
                with better features, and are quite a rage these days.</p>
            &nbsp;

            <p>A couple of things to check with DSLR cameras is their MegaPixel count which describes the resolution,
                battery type, sensor type and size, and shutter speed. DSLR cameras with good sensor give you pictures
                that are sharp and detailed even when enlarged. A cameraâ€™s sensor size gives you an idea of how wide a
                view it can cover. The processor of a DSLR camera is another detail to look into. Cameras with a good
                processor reduce noise and give you equally crisp pictures in both bright and dim lighting. DSLR cameras
                like the Canon EOS 1300D feature Wi-Fi connectivity and built-in NFC technology which let you transfer
                pictures and videos from your camera to your smartphone with a finger tap.</p>

            <p>These cameras are not that popular when it comes to their features. They usually have interchangeable
                lenses and donâ€™t have the usual mirror, which makes them a lightweight and compact option when compared
                to DSLR cameras.</p>&nbsp;

            <p><b>Cameras - Frequently Asked Questions</b></p>
            

            <p><b>1. Why should I buy a DSLR camera?</b></p>
            <p>Digital Single Lens Reflex (DSLR) cameras are being widely bought and used today for various reasons that
                make them hugely popular. With large sensor area, high shutter speeds( can capture up to 10 frames per
                second), much better sensitivity to light, ability to use different lenses for different situations,
                great control over the depth of field( the ability to create beautiful bokeh) and many more such reasons
                prompt photographers into buying DSLR cameras online. These let you change lenses and hence you can
                manually set exposure and focus. They deliver crispier and cleaner images as they have larger internal
                image sensors than point-and-shoot cameras.</p>&nbsp;

            <p><b>2. What resolution do I need to get sharp photos?</b></p>
            <p>For printing out decently clear photographs you can use cameras with the resolution between 16 MP to 24
                MP. The higher the resolution, the clearer will be the photos. If you only wish to post photos on the
                web or have a soft copy of the same, you don't really need cameras with very high resolution. You can go
                for Canon EOS 100D DSLR camera which is of 18 MP or cameras from Nikon, Sony and other good brands.</p>&nbsp;

            <p><b>3. What is the difference between actual pixel count and effective pixel count?</b></p>
            <p><span>Some brands publish two-pixel count numbers. These are the actual and effective pixel count
                    numbers. The actual pixel count number is the actual pixel numbers present on the sensor. On the
                    other hand, effective number is the number of pixels on the sensor that are used for image
                    formation. All the pixels are not used for image formation.</span></p>&nbsp;

            <p><b>4. Which are some of the good digital cameras under Rs 30,000?</b></p>
            <p><span>A number of good brands manufacture cameras under Rs 30,000. You can go for some of the best brands
                    as these will last long, like Nikon D3400 DSLR Camera Body with Single Lens- having an aperture size
                    of f/3.5-5.6 and focal length of 18-55 mm. You can also go for Canon EOS 1300D DSLR Camera Body with
                    Single Lens â€“ having an aperture size of f/3.5-5.6, 18-55mm focal length and 18 MP
                    resolution.</span></p>&nbsp;



            <p><b>5. What are the factors one must look at while buying a camera?</b></p>

            <p>Most of us only look at the resolution/ the pixel count while buying a big or <a
                    href="/q/small-cameras">small camera</a>. Although this is an important feature, there are various
                other aspects that you need to consider. Some of these are the pixel size, sensor size, focal length,
                aperture size among others. Each of these determines the clarity of the photo by controlling light.</p>
