            <h2><strong>New Television Launches:</strong></h2>

            <h2><strong>Realme TV - Affordable, Convenient, and Innovative</strong></h2>

            <p>When you are extremely bored, but you still don’t feel like going out and doing something adventurous,
                then watching TV is always a great option for just about anyone to consider. And, if you have a <a
                    href="/launching-realme-smart-led-tv-store">Realme TV</a> to help you do that, then is there
                anything more that one can ask for? A good TV, like we all know, helps you watch programs from all over
                the world. But, that’s where things have changed. TVs have become so much more that if you aren’t a tech
                enthusiast, then you’ll probably face some difficulty in catching up with the different features that
                most present-day TVs boast, and the features that you should be looking for. Luckily for you, we have
                listed most of those features below so that you won’t have to spend additional time on the Internet
                looking for them. Here, take a look:</p>

            <h3><b>Seamless Design</b></h3>

            <p>Almost everyone today mounts their Realme TVs onto walls. And, if the bezels of your TVs are too wide,
                then they will look tacky. That’s why a TV with wide bezels is highly undesirable nowadays. What you
                might want to look for is a Realme LED TV that boasts a bezel-less design. Such a design not only helps
                the TV look incredible, but it also adds a whole new component of aesthetics to your home/office’s
                interior. On top of that, a bezel-less design helps make the display look seamless, making the video
                content you’re watching more immersive.</p>

            <h3><b>Powerful Sound</b></h3>

            <p>What’s one thing that makes a TV different from a radio? Its screen. But, that doesn’t mean that good
                picture-quality is all a TV should offer; it should offer good sound as well. That’s why most Realme
                smart TVs come with Dolby Audio technology, which augments the overall entertainment experience by
                delivering heart-thumping bass and crisp highs. Looks like your favourite video content just got more
                enjoyable - doesn’t it?</p>

            <h3><b>Visuals</b></h3>

            <p>We can talk about all the aspects of a modern TV, but the primary thing that you should be looking for in
                a TV is its picture quality - isn’t it? Almost all the TVs from Realme feature the Chroma Boost Picture
                Engine and a 64-bit MediaTek processor to make for seamless and lag-free visuals that are also rich,
                clear, crisp, and full of vibrant colours.<br>
                &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Apart from what we’ve mentioned above, Realme TVs also come with other incredible features, such as the
                Google Assistant, Chromecast built-in, and 24W quad speakers, among other things. So, why waste your
                time looking for other TVs that boast similar features, especially when you know that TVs from Realme
                are loaded with them? So, hurry up. Go online now and purchase a TV of your choice from Realme
                today.<br>

            <h2><strong>Kodak CA Series 4K TVs - TVs for Modern Homes</strong></h2>

            <p>Like every other thing in this world, large home appliances, such as TVs, need to stay updated with the
                latest technologies. And, a <a href="/launching-kodak-ca-series-4k-tvs-with-android9-store">Kodak CA
                    Series 4K TV</a> is one such TV that’s up there with some innovative features. But, for you to be
                certain that the TV you’re buying isn’t outdated, you need to check for the following factors:<br>
                &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Seamless Design - Since you’ll be setting up your TV in your living room or your bedroom, you need to
                ensure that it has the design to complement your decor. Otherwise, what’s the point? Almost all Kodak CA
                Series TVs today come with bezel-less design that makes them look like magnificent pieces of art when
                you mount them onto a wall. On top of that, such a design maximises the viewing area, adding to your
                viewing experience.<br>
                &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Google Assistant - When you’re glued to the couch, watching your favourite TV show, any task that
                requires you to leave your seat seems extremely annoying - doesn’t it? Fortunately, a lot of Kodak TVs
                feature the Google Assistant. You can take advantage of it to check what the weather’s like, how much
                your favourite team has scored, or even look for the answers to stupid questions on Google, among other
                things. Thanks to that, you won’t have to reach for your phone or even your computer, which may not be
                near you at that point. Convenient, right?<br>
                &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Fast Refresh Rate - What separates a great TV from the good ones is its refresh rate. I mean, most
                expensive TV have more or less the same picture quality, but are their screens equally responsive?
                Probably not. Kodak CA Series 4K TVs come with MEMC and a refresh rate of 60 Hz, so you don’t have to
                deal with lag especially when you’re busy gaming.<br>
                &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Display and Sound - You can have all the features in the world in a TV, but if the image and sound
                quality aren’t up to the mark, then it is a bad investment - isn’t it? Technologies, such as Dolby
                Vision and Dolby Digital Plus, help certain Kodak TVs deliver high-quality visuals and incredible audio
                that augment each other to ensure that you enjoy an entertaining experience.<br>
                &nbsp;</p>

            <h3>Buy Kodak CA Series 4K TVs Online</h3>

            <p>Be it a Kodak CA Series LED 4K TV or any other TV from Kodak, you can find them all on online shopping
                portals. You can do everything from shortlisting different models to comparing their features and
                prices, among other things, in a jiffy. Also, installing the TV is not your headache as professionals
